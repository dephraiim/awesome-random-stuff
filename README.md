Yayyy!
I do not mean anything I say here

### July 16, 2020
- Github is shipping software into the future, why didn't I become a developer early. I want to be part.
- New Github organization. I don't think It will last long, just trying it out though

### July 20, 2020
- Thought this will be a daily thing but I guess not. 
- I am bored and seriosly, I am tired of coding. I always do what I want to do and I do them because I can do them. No one has forced me, I have never dreamed of becoming a software developer. I learned how to code because It was fun and cool with the things you can build.
- I actually never thought I could get this far and now that I am far enough, I feel it is ok. My journey ends here but something tells me it is not.
- I guess I will keep learning. For now.
